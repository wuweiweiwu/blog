Hi, my name is Wei-Wei.

Right now I am a software engineer at [Assembled](https://www.assembled.com/), where I'm working on next-generation workforce management tools.

Previously, I was at [Density](https://density.io/), where I built [Atlas](https://density.io/atlas), the flagship space insights and analysis tool. Before that, I was the first engineer at [Nashi](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/density-acquires-nashi-a-desk--and-space-reservation-solution-to-better-enable-hybrid-workplaces-301321843.html), where I built software to help employees collaborate in a hybrid workplace.

I love startups, open source, and frontend infrastructure.

Find me on [Github](https://github.com/wuweiweiwu), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hungweiwu/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wuweiweiwu).
