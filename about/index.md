# About Me

Hi, my name is Wei-Wei.

Right now I am founding a company within the data and analytics space.

Previously, I built software at a couple of different startups. I specialize in building and launching 0-1 products and creating tooling to enable engineers to iterate and ship quickly.

I love startups, open source, and web infrastructure.

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/wuweiweiwu), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hungweiwu/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wuweiweiwu).
