# About Me

Hi, my name is Wei-Wei.

Right now I am working on my startup focusing on autonomous agents with LLMs!

For the past few years, I've been a maintainer of Storybook and Rollup, as well as a plethora other NPM packages with a total of over 100m+ downloads monthly. I'm highly active on GitHub and have contributed to numerous projects, including React and Node.js.

I geek out about web infra and dev tooling and occasionally blog about tech.

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/wuweiweiwu), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hungweiwu/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wuweiweiwu).
