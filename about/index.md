Hi, my name is Wei-Wei, and I work a lot on SaaS products.

I am a fullstack and infrastructure engineer. Right now I am a product engineer at [Density](https://density.io/), where I'm working on next-generation physical space analytic tools.

Previously, I was the first engineer at [Nashi](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/density-acquires-nashi-a-desk--and-space-reservation-solution-to-better-enable-hybrid-workplaces-301321843.html) where I built software to help employees collaborate in a hybrid workplace.

I love startups, open source, and frontend infrastructure.
